# hello-world
First original git repo

I'm new here! I'm an aspiring data scientist and this is my first repo that I created in github. 

I'm from NC and live with my husband and infant daughter. I have a cat named Cinderella.
I sew clothing, and made a wedding dress for my sister.

I have lived lots of different places, but all in the mid-Atlantic. Most recently, I moved away from Charlottesville, Virginia.
